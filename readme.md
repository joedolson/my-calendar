## Contact

Support questions should be sent via the Support form that appears on the Help screen within the plug-in.

Note: this is currently failing tests. The failures are due to a change in test requirements to require strict comparisons, which will take some time to review and complete. It will not pass all tests again until version 3.2.0.

Bugs or feature development contributions should be made through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joedolson/my-calendar/issues)
